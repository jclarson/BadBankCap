# Name

Bad Bank

# Description

This is a React project to simulate a bank's user interface.
It brings together all the knowledge from the MIT xPro course I have been taking.
This is a 3-tier application incorporating front-end and back-end, and attaches to a database.
Users are separated into customers and admins.
Admin users can create additional admin users and can see data for all users.
Customers can create additional customer accounts and are only able to see data for their own account.

# Technology Used

MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.JS).

# Installation

Download the files.  Start a MongoDB database listening on port 27017. Run node index.js from the directory to which the files were downloaded.

# Usage

After Installation has been completed, open a browser to localhost:3000.

# Features

Basic security requiring email and password to authenticate.

# Support

No support is provided for this application.  Use at your own discretion.

# Roadmap

Plans to possibly add better authentication, plus improvements to the UI such as the ability to display individual transactions rather than just balances.
